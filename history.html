      <b>The start of a empire</b><br>
  
  In 1976 while he was an engineering intern at HP, Wozniak designed his own microcomputer using the new microprocessor from the Homebrew Computer Club, that he and Steve Jobs were a part of. When he presented his design to HP, they weren't interested in his design. Wozniak showed his design to Jobs, and he showed a lot of enthusiasm to Wozniak’s design, then they decided to work together to make their own company, Apple Computer Inc.
  <br>
  In 1977 after the promising sales of their microcomputer circuit board business run out of Jobs’ family garage, they decided to release a final product, with Wozniak’s advanced engineering and Jobs’ aesthetic sense they made The Apple II, it had a built-in keyboard, and support for a coloured monitor. The Apple II was quoted as “a runaway success by all accounts.” the company went public in 1980, its market value exceeded $1 billion, which at the time was the fastest rise to that milestone in corporate history. Wozniak’s stock in the company made him an instant multimillionaire.
  <p><br><b>The path to the future</b><br>
  After the release of The Apple II a large amount of Apple’s employees wanted to focus on refining The Apple II and make successive versions. But Jobs soon became dissatisfied, his interest in The Apple II ran out. When rumours that IMB was making a personal computer, Apple’s gave him the budget and resources to make The Apple III. By 1979 Jobs became more and more disheartened on The Apple III’s progress. Then by chance, Xerox became an investor in Apple, and granted Apple a look inside their R&D center in exchange for a discount on Apple’s equity. When Jobs and his team visited Xerox PARC, they were shown three remarkable developments: the graphical user interface, or GUI, object-oriented programming, and networked computer systems. Then Jobs was convinced GUI was the future of computing.
